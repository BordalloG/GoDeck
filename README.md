# Go Deck
This program intends to represent a deck of playing cards.  
The program allows you to: 
- Create a new deck.
- Print the card from an existing deck.
- Deal cards from an existing deck.
- Create a string that contains all the cards from an existing deck.
- Save an existing deck to a file.
- Load a deck from a file.
- Shuffle an existing deck.

This program is originally from [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide) course. But I added a couple of things more than was presented.

# Requirements
